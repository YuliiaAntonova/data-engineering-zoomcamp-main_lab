Question 1: What is count of records for the 2022 Green Taxi Data??
- 65,623,481
- 840,402
- 1,936,423
- 253,647

SELECT count(*) FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.external_green_tripdata`;

## Question 2:
Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.</br>
What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?
-- Count distinct PULocationIDs from the External Table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PULocationID) AS distinct_pu_location_ids_external
FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.external_green_tripdata`;

-- Count distinct PULocationIDs from the Table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PULocationID) AS distinct_pu_location_ids_table
FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.green_tripdata_non_partitioned`;

- 0 MB for the External Table and 6.41MB for the Materialized Table

## Question 3:
How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.external_green_tripdata`
WHERE fare_amount = 0;

- 1,622

## Question 4:
What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always order the results by PUlocationID and filter based on lpep_pickup_datetime? (Create a new table with this strategy)

- Partition by lpep_pickup_datetime and Partition by PUlocationID

-- CREATE TABLE `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.optimized_table`
-- PARTITION BY DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime)
-- CLUSTER BY PUlocationID
-- AS
-- SELECT * FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.green_tripdata_non_partitioned`;

## Question 5:
Write a query to retrieve the distinct PULocationID between lpep_pickup_datetime
06/01/2022 and 06/30/2022 (inclusive)</br>

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 4 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values? </br>

Choose the answer which most closely matches.</br>

- 12.82 MB for non-partitioned table and 1.12 MB for the partitioned table

-- -- For the partitioned table
SELECT DISTINCT PULocationID
FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.green_tripdata_non_partitioned`
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN TIMESTAMP("2022-06-01") AND TIMESTAMP("2022-06-30");

-- For the non-partitioned table
SELECT DISTINCT PULocationID
FROM `abiding-splicer-412408.dataset_demo.optimized_table`
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN TIMESTAMP("2022-06-01") AND TIMESTAMP("2022-06-30");

## Question 6:
Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

- GCP Bucket

## Question 7:
It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:
- False
